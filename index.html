			<p align="justify">Ilia Markov holds a tenured position as an Assistant Professor at 
			<a href="https://vu.nl/en" target="_blank">the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a>. 
			Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at 
			<a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/" target="_blank">the Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics Research Center (CLiPS)</a>
			at <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/" target="_blank">the University of Antwerp</a>, Belgium, 
			and at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en" target="_blank">the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA)</a>, Paris, France. 
			He received his PhD in Computer Science (with honors) from 
			<a href="https://www.ipn.mx/ingles/" target="_blank">the National Polytechnic Institute</a>, Mexico, in 2018, 
			focusing on authorship analysis, particularly on native language identification, 
			where he introduced novel computational methods leveraging cognates, etymology, and emotion-based information.</p>	
		
			<p align="justify">His current research aims to foster more inclusive and respectful online communication by mitigating online hate speech and 
			developing context-aware, personalized counterspeech strategies tailored to authors' sociodemographic profiles. 
			He also investigates cross-domain scalability and the reasoning capabilities of AI models.</p>

			<p align="justify">He has published over 60 peer-reviewed papers in journals and conference proceedings, 
			co-organized several international competitions on automatic authorship identification, 
			and served as Senior Area Chair for LREC-COLING 2024. 
			Throughout his career, he has received several awards and honors, 
			including the Outstanding Academic Performance Award for PhD students at the National Polytechnic Institute.</p>
